## Steps to Add Your Article

2. Click on the green **Code** button and choose **Download ZIP**.
3. Extract the ZIP file on your computer.

### 2. Open the Articles Folder

1. Find the folder named `articles` in the extracted files.
2. Open this folder.

### 3. Create a New Folder for Your Article

1. Right-click inside the `articles` folder.
2. Select **New Folder**.
3. Name the folder using your article title. Use hyphens `-` or underscores `_` instead of spaces (e.g., `my-article-title`).

### 4. Create an `index.md` File

1. Open the new folder you just created.
2. Right-click inside this folder.
3. Select **New** and then **Text Document** (or **New File**, depending on your system).
4. Name the file `index.md` (make sure to change the file extension from `.txt` to `.md`).

### 5. Write Your Article

1. Open the `index.md` file with a text editor (like Notepad, TextEdit, or any Markdown editor).
2. Start writing your article. You can use simple formatting like headings, bullet points, and links. Hereâ€™s an example to get you started:

   ```markdown
   # Your Article Title

   Write your content here. You can add lists, links, and more!
   ```

### 6. Add Images

1. If you want to include images, save them in the same folder as your `index.md` file.
2. To add an image in your article, use this format in the `index.md` file:

   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](image-filename.jpg)
   ```

   Replace `image-filename.jpg` with the name of your image file.

### 7. Save Your Changes

Make sure to save the changes to your `index.md` file.

### 8. Prepare to Upload

1. Go back to the main folder where you extracted the files.
2. Select the `articles` folder (and everything inside it, including your new article folder).
3. Right-click and choose **Compress** (or **Zip**). This creates a new ZIP file with your changes.

### 9. Upload Your Changes to GitHub

2. Click on **New pull request**.
3. Fill out any necessary information and submit your pull request for review.

## Basics of Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text easily. Here are some basic elements you can use in your `index.md` file:

### Headings

Use `#` symbols to create headings. The number of `#` symbols indicates the heading level.

- `# Heading 1` (largest)
- `## Heading 2`
- `### Heading 3`
- `#### Heading 4` (smallest)

### Emphasis

- **Bold**: Use double asterisks or double underscores.
  - Example: `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`
  
- *Italic*: Use single asterisks or single underscores.
  - Example: `*italic text*` or `_italic text_`

### Lists

- **Unordered Lists**: Use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens.
  - Example:
    ```markdown
    - Item 1
    - Item 2
    ```

- **Ordered Lists**: Use numbers followed by a period.
  - Example:
    ```markdown
    1. First item
    2. Second item
    ```

### Links

To add a hyperlink, use the following format:

```markdown
[Link text](http://example.com)
```

### Images

To add an image, use this format:

```markdown
![Alt text](image-filename.jpg)
```

Replace `Alt text` with a brief description of the image, and `image-filename.jpg` with the image's filename.
